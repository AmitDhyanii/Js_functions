// 1. Shortest Program in JS: Empty file. Still, browsers make global EC and global space along with Window object.
// 2. Global Space: Anything that is not in a function, is in the global space.
// 3. Variables present in a global space can be accessed by a "window" object. (like window.a)
// 4. In global space, (this === window) object.
// 5. this keyword created with GEC(global execution context) or execution context 
// 6. this points to global object which is window incase of browser   


var a = 10;

console.log(a);
console.log(window.a);
console.log(this.a);





// 1.Undefined is a Special Placeholder which is used to reserve memory for the variables in the memory creation phase. Even before a single line of code is executed JS engine assigns undefined to the variables.

// 2.Not Defined means if we try to console or access any variable which is not declared in the code then we get Not Defined error.

// 3. JS is a loosely typed language or weakly typed language means it does not attaches its variables to specific data types like in C++ and java.

// 4.Remember undefined !== not defined.









// temporal dead zone

// 1. let and const are hoisted but its memory is allocated at other place than window which cannot be accessed before initialisation.
// 2. Temporal Dead Zone exists until variable is declared and assigned a value.
// 3. window.variable OR this.variable will not give value of variable defined using let or const.
// 4. We cannot redeclare the same variable with let/const(even with using var the second time).
// 5. const variable declaration and initialisation must be done on the same line.
// 6. There are three types of error: [1] referenceError {given where variable does not have memory allocation} [2] typeError {given when we change type that is not supposed to be changed} [3] syntaxError {when proper syntax(way of writing a statement) is not used}.
// 7. Use const wherever possible followed by let, Use var as little as possible(only if you have to). It helps avoid error.
// 8. Initialising variables at the top is good idea, helps shrinks TDZ to zero.








// 1. Code inside curly bracket is called block.
// 2. Multiple statements are grouped inside a block so it can be written where JS expects single statements like in if, else, loop, function etc.
// 3. Block values are stored inside separate memory than global. They are stored in block. (the reason let and const are called block scope)

// 4. Shadowing of variables using var, let and const.
// 5. The shadow should not cross the scope of original otherwise it will give error.
// 6. shadowing let with var is illegal shadowing and gives error.
// 7. var value is stored in nearest outer function or global scope and hence can be accessed outside block as well whereas same is not the case with let and const.
